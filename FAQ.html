                <h1>FAQ</h1>
                <h2>Why are you running for City Commission?</h2>
                <p>I am running for a seat on the Great Falls City Commission to continue my work in building the economy,
                workforce, education, and community. I firmly believe Great Falls is an excellent place to do business,
                receive an education, raise a family, and recreate. Great Falls has it.</p>
                <h2>What are your top priorities if elected?</h2>
                <p>One of my priorities, if elected, is to encourage collaborative and inclusive partnerships across all the
                community entities. We are Better Together. </p>
                <p>I am proud to see the impact of partnerships at the local, state and federal level in securing $4.25 million
                to build the new dental education building at Great Falls College MSU, another $1.5 million economic
                development grant to expand welding facilities at the college and a $25 million RevUp Montana grant to
                reduce the skill gap for jobs across Montana and increase work-based learning and apprenticeships.
                Together, we can adapt and grow as a community.</p>
                <h2>Why should people vote for you?</h2>
                <p>I am an experienced leader and have managed multi-million dollar budgets, made difficult decisions to
                balance revenues with expenditures, and am forward looking and leading.
                At each college and university where I worked, I created and was recognized for many workforce
                programs to advance opportunities for others to have better jobs and careers as well as enhance
                economic development. I led the Training and Economic Development Center at one of the colleges
                where I worked.</p>
                <p>Being adaptable is key to building a future. Our agriculture industry and medical communities are
                shining examples of having to innovate, take risks, and keep moving forward. 
                 I am a strong supporter of our military partners, having participated in the ESGR program and attended
                the US Air Force War College’s National Security Forum. My father was a pilot in the 7 th Ferrying
                Command at Gore Field during WWII having completed his last 18 months of service flying the Burma
                Hump.</p>
                <h2>How will you help the community of Great Falls overcome the friction, and ultimately, functional stalemate caused by divisiveness?</h2>
                <p>I believe differing views is the “bread and butter” of a civil, successful community. Divisiveness 
                and stalemates occur when people do not seek to understand the thinking of people with whom they 
                disagree. Being inclusive in our thinking and dynamics, being willing to compromise and build toward 
                the betterment of the community, and leading with humility invites more people to be involved. Every 
                community needs willing leaders who craft the next story and success.</p>
                <h2>Any opinion on tightening the fireworks rules?</h2>
                <p>The City Manager and Department leads have asked the Neighborhood Councils to query the residents 
                of the neighborhoods about fireworks. I have attended several of the Councils’ meetings and there 
                have been lively discussions, primarily focused on safety issues and the concern that responding to 
                fireworks calls diverts emergency responders. </p>
                <p>This topic is top of mind in the summer, but changing policy or how current policy is enforced 
                involves listening to a lot of perspectives and taking time to craft smart solutions. I encourage 
                everyone to attend your Neighborhood Council meeting or contact the City Manager and Mayor to have 
                your voice heard.</p>
