                <h1>FAQ</h1>
                <h2>Why are you running for City Commission?</h2>
                <p>I am running for a seat on the Great Falls City Commission to continue my work in building the economy,
                workforce, education, and community. I firmly believe Great Falls is an excellent place to do business,
                receive an education, raise a family, and recreate. Great Falls has it.</p>
                <h2>What are your top priorities if elected?</h2>
                <p>One of my priorities, if elected, is to encourage collaborative and inclusive partnerships across all the
                community entities. We are Better Together. </p>
                <p>I am proud to see the impact of partnerships at the local, state and federal level in securing $4.25 million
                to build the new dental education building at Great Falls College MSU, another $1.5 million economic
                development grant to expand welding facilities at the college and a $25 million RevUp Montana grant to
                reduce the skill gap for jobs across Montana and increase work-based learning and apprenticeships.
                Together, we can adapt and grow as a community.</p>
                <h2>Why should people vote for you?</h2>
                <p>I am an experienced leader and have managed multi-million dollar budgets, made difficult decisions to
                balance revenues with expenditures, and am forward looking and leading.
                At each college and university where I worked, I created and was recognized for many workforce
                programs to advance opportunities for others to have better jobs and careers as well as enhance
                economic development. I led the Training and Economic Development Center at one of the colleges
                where I worked.</p>
                <p>Being adaptable is key to building a future. Our agriculture industry and medical communities are
                shining examples of having to innovate, take risks, and keep moving forward. 
                 I am a strong supporter of our military partners, having participated in the ESGR program and attended
                the US Air Force War College’s National Security Forum. My father was a pilot in the 7 th Ferrying
                Command at Gore Field during WWII having completed his last 18 months of service flying the Burma
                Hump.</p>
